# Mechanics
Game mechanic ideas or mechanics from games I'm interested in iterating on.

## Factorio
- The destroyers have a territory mechanic where they will destroy buildings until they are defeated. I wonder if something similar could work in a voxel based game where chunks are marked as territory until a "boss", set of enemies is defeated, specific item destroyed, etc.

## Hollow Knight
- I liked the multi-level nature of the game where different biomes towards an "abyss".

# Anti Mechanics

## Factorio
- There isn't an easy way to destroy items.
