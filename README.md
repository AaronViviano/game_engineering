# game_engineering
A repository for game notes, ideas, concepts, libraries, prototypes, and development.

## Games I'd like to make:
* A closed world race track like fast hover car shooter game with power ups.
  * Might make a good game to try with a "professional" game engine where I could rely on the engine's effects over complex models.
* An open world first person rpg.
* Tactical isometric combat game.
* A colony simulation game.
* A 4x strategy game.
* Make a Myst like puzzle game.
  * Potentially good for learning 3D modeling.
* An infinite structure exploration game.
* A phone based gear puzzle game.
* A top down fast paced shooter game. Like Teleglitch.
* A first person shooter.
* A zelda-like game.
* An open world scifi flight sim.
  * Possible a good "arcade" style game.
* An abandoned ship "survival/exploration" game.
* A minecraft like game.
  * Where building for defense is important and the world generates factions.
* A metroidvania game.
* A liminal puzzle game about tranportation signs that you see at the airport.
